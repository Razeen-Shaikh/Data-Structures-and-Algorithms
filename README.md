# Data Structures and Algorithms

**Data Structures** is about storing data in different structures.

**Algorithms** are about how to solve different problems, often by searching through and manipulating data structures.

Theory about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) helps us to use large amounts of data to solve problems efficiently.
